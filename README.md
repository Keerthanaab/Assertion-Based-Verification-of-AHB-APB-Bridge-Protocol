# Assertion-Based-Verification-of-AHB-APB-Bridge-Protocol
The AHB-APB bridge serves as a critical interface, enabling seamless communication between the high-performance Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB) and the power-efficient Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB). The repository outlines the strategies and methodologies used to ensure the bridge meets all design specifications and operational requirements.

The project involved analyzing the design specifications of the AHB2APB bridge and deriving a comprehensive set of properties to validate its functionality. These properties served as the foundation for crafting a suite of assertions, assumptions, and coverage properties aimed at evaluating key aspects of the bridgeâ€™s capabilities. These included handling burst transactions, proper signal propagation, memory mapping, and
peripheral control.
